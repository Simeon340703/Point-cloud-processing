# Point cloud processing
Point clouds are data points defined in a three-dimensional space, often generated by 3D scanners or LiDAR sensors. These data points represent the external surfaces of objects and scenes, making point clouds crucial for various applications such as 3D modeling, object recognition, and environment mapping. In this blog, weâ€™ll explore how to work with point clouds using the Open3D library, covering essential tasks like reading, visualizing, downsampling, clustering, segmentation, and computing normal.
